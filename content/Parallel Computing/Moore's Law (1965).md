The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year. Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue. If not to increase. Over the longer term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. That means by 1975, the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum costs will be 65,000.

In 1975, Moore predicted that we've saturated our intelligence and there will be no innovation to make things faster.

The Moore's law was expected to last 10 years, however it have been stood still as of now (2023).
