The CODASYL model organized a collection of [[2. IMS Era#^198bcf|record types]], each with keys, into a network, rather than a tree. Hence a given record can have multiple parents unlike in [[2. IMS Era|IMS]]'s single parent.

Here, we notice 3 types [[2. IMS Era#^198bcf|record type]] arranged in a network, connected by 2 named arcs (Supplies and Supplied_by).
A named arc is called a [[#^47608e|set]] in CODASYL (not the mathematical set).

A CODASYL network is a collection of named [[2. IMS Era#^198bcf|record type]] and named set tyupes that form a connected graph. There must be one *entry point* (a record type that is not a set type) 

### Observations of the network
In the CODASYL network it is ok to have a part that is not supplied by anybody. This will merely be an empty instance of Supplied_by set.

### Three way relationships
Consider data about a marriage ceremony, which is a 3-way relationship between a bride, a groom and a minister, which is a 3-way relationship between a bride, groom and minister.

## Extras
Set - a **set** in CODASYL network indicates that for each record of the **owner** record type (the tail of the arrow) there is a relationship with zero or more record instances of the child record type (the head of the arrow). It is a 1-n relationship between owner record and child record. ^47608e
