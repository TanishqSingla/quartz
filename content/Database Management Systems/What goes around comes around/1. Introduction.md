## Introduction
Data model proposals have been around since 1960s, this paper summarizes the history of 35 years of data models, these models are grouped into 9 eras. The purpose of this paper is to make sure to avoid replaying history by future researchers.
Unfortunately the current XML era bears a striking resemblance to the CODASYL proposal from 1970s, which failed due to its complexity, hence the current era is replaying the history.
The nine historical epochs are:
-   Hierarchical ([[2. IMS Era |IMS]]): late 1960s and 1970s
-   Network ([[3. CODASYL Era|CODASYL]]): 1970s
-   Relational: 1970s and 1980s
-   Entity-Relationship: 1970s
-   Extended Relational: 1980s
-   Semantic: late 1970s and 1980s
-   Object-oriented: late 1980s and early 1990s
-   Object-relational : late 1980s and early 1990s
-   Semi-structured (XML): late 1990s - present
