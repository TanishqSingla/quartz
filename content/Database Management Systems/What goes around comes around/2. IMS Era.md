IMS was released in 1968, and initially had a heirarchichal data model.
- IMS understood the notion of [[#^198bcf|record type]], which is a collection of named fields with their associated data types. 
- Each instance of the [[#^198bcf|record type]] is forced to obey the data description indicated in the description of the record type.
- Furthermore, some subset of the named fields must uniquely specify record instance i.e. they are required to be a key.
- The [[#^198bcf|record type]] must be arranged in a tree, such that each record type has a unique parent record type.

Due to the requirements of tree-structure data there are some challenges because we are forced to structure it in one of the two ways indicated. These representation share two common undesirable properties
![[IMS-Fig-1.png]]
1. **Information is repeated**. 
	In the first schema Part is repeated for each Supplier who supplies the part.
	In the second schema Supplier information is repeated for each part he supplies.
	Repeated information is undesirable because it offers the possibility of inconsistent data. E.g a repeated data elementd could be changed in some, but not all of the places it appears.
2. **Existence Depends on Parent**. 
	In the first schema it is impossible for there to be a part that is not currenlty not supplied by anyone. 
	In the second schema it is impossible to have a supplier which does not currently supply anything.
	There is no support for these 'corner cases' in a strict heirarchy.

IMS chose heirarchichal database because it facilitates a simple data manipulation language DL/1.
Every record in IMS has a [[#^062c5a|HKS]]. HSK defines natural order of all records i.e depth-first, left-to-right.

## Extras
- Record - A record type in IMS is a collection of named fields with their associated types. ^198bcf
- HKS (Heirarchichal Sequence Key) - HSK is derived by concatenating the keys of ancestor record and then adding the key of curent record. ^062c5a
