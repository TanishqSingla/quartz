In AWS servers are virtual and the server to use to gain access to virtual server is called EC2.

## Advantages of EC2
- Highly Flexible
- Cost-effective
- Quick

## Conventional way
- In a traditional way, you would calculate your application requirement and purchase the right server and the right amount of them according to that and pay the cost of the hardware upfront.
- Vendors can take up to weeks to deliver that hardware.
- Finally when the server will arrive you would wire it up and assemble it on-premise.

## Multitenancy 
Sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines.

## Types of EC2 Instances
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Accelerated Computing
