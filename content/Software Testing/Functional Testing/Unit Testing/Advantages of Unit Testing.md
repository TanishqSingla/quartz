**Early detection of problems in the development cycles**

> Writing unit tests enables to find problems early, including both bugs in the implementation or missing parts of the [[Unit Testing#^3463b6|unit's]] specification.

**Reduced Cost**

> Finding problem during the code process is considerably lower in cost than find the problem in the cost of detecting, identifying and correcting the bug.  
> Also reduces the chances to avoid more costly problems for the end user.

**Detects Changes which may break a design contract**

> Unit tests detect changes which may break a [[design contract]].

**Test Driven Development**

> - In [[Test Driven Development|test driven development]] or [[scrum]] unit tests are written before the code itself.
> - If the unit test fails it is considered as a bug, and it also helps the location of the fault to be easily traced. Since unit test failures are treated as bugs this alerts the developer before handing over.

**Allow for code refactoring**

> Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor the code or upgrade the system libraries at a later date, and makes sure those changes works correctly.

**Reduce uncertainty**

> Unit testing may reduce uncertainty in the [[Unit Testing#^3463b6|unit]] themselves and can be used in a [[Bottom Up|bottom-up style of testing]] approach (i.e testing parts of the programs first and then sum of programs). [[Integration Testing]] becomes much easier.

**Documentation of a system behavior**

> - Unit testing provides a sort of living documentation of the system. It allows developers to just check the unit test and understand the [[Unit Testing#^3463b6|unit's]] functionality.
