# Overview
Web application have fall short when navigating through different states of the application. For e.g in the Tata 1MG application when we navigate our application in the applicatino we can see a beautiful transtition between the pages i.e how pages slide over each other, however on the web application we can not see the similar effect. 


## View Transition API
The web browsers introduces a new api called viewTransition, which tackles one of the specific issue mentioned above, and it also introduces pseudo selectors to style using css.
