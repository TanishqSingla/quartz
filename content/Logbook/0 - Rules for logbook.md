This page is to remind me of the standards needs to be followed, while writing this logbook

## Rule 1: Once a topic is in logbook it remains in logbook

Logbook pages should not be deleted in any circumstances no matter how silly they are, if a particular entry is wrong then a `heading 1` title `Update` should be mentioned at the top of the content of the blog.

## Rule 2: Sub-Headings

The subheadings of the logbook should be `heading 2` i.e `<h2>` or in other words `##`

## Rule 3: Follow Up

If a blog has a follow up it is recommended to make a separate entry with `#` same as the blog which is being followed and adding a `.<NUM>` , if the follow up is small, then the follow up can be written in the last of the blog with a sub-heading `Update` or `Follow Up` followed by date in bracket `()` . (Check entry #1 for reference)
